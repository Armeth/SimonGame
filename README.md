# SimonGame

Just a quick SimonGame tutorial I'm following. One thing I don't understand is why the <script> acts differently between Chrome and Firefox. If you open it in Chrome
the topLeft panel flashes for a very short amount time while the others do so for the correct amount of time. I suspect it is something to do with the way the two
browsers load the elements of the page.
